    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // *** Team is not the array. It's a just reference to the original array.
    // When you edit the array, it's going to go back to the reference. ***



    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // The slice() method selects from a given start, up to a (not inclusive) given end.
    // The slice() method does not change the original array.
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // spread can also spread into a function, as well
    team4[3] = 'woohoo';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }); 
    console.log(cap2);

    // the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; // spread into an object
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const les = {
      name: 'Les',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@LeslieMedia',
        linkedin: 'leslieagonzalez'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(les);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, les);

    // deep clone workaround
    // take JSON.stringify and pass it an Object, which returns a String
    // then immediately JSON.parse it, which turns it back into an Object
    // gives you a Full Copy, but check performance
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(les));
